<h2>Warming of Oceans.</h2>
<p>The water in the Southern Ocean is also warming. Warmer ocean water not only speeds the melting of ice shelves, but also has an impact on the sensitive marine ecosystem of the Southern Ocean. Antarctic krill, an important animal the start of the Southern Ocean food chain, are projected to lose up to 80 percent of their habitat by 2100 because of warming waters and melting sea ice.</p>

<h2>Loss of Habitat</h2>
<p>Areas of the Antarctic Peninsula that were once lively Adélie penguin colonies are now abandoned because of less winter sea ice. Many of these penguins have moved south to colder areas. Scientists are concerned that gentoo penguins, who live in isolated colonies and do not typically swim far from home, might not be able to relocate as easily as other penguin species as climate change makes their current habitat unsuitable.</p>
</div>

<div class=rise3>
    <h2>Emperor penguins</h2><p>are also affected because the sea ice they depend upon for breeding is melting. Scientists predict that if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise at levels similar to today—causing temperatures to rise and Antarctic Sea ice to shrink—the penguin population numbers will diminish slowly until about 2040. Nearly 98% of Emperor penguin colonies are at risk of disappearing by 2100.
