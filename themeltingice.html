<h2>Temperatures are rising.</h2>
<p>The Antarctic Peninsula, the part of Antarctica furthest from the South Pole, has been warming rapidly, five times faster than the global average. Since 1950, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed almost 3째C (5.4째F). That's more warming than anywhere else in the Southern Hemisphere. Overall warmer temperatures along the peninsula are increasing ice melt and have caused several ice shelves to break apart.</p>
</div>

<div class=callout2>
<h2>Ice Shelves are collapsing.</h2>
<p>Between 1992 and 2017, Antarctica lost more than three trillion tons of ice, most of which came from the West Antarctica Ice Sheet. Some of the most dramatic impacts of warming are collapsing ice shelves in West Antarctica, which are caused by warming.  Ice shelves are like bookends that support ice sheets and glaciers, helping them stay on land. When an ice shelf collapses into the ocean, the glaciers that it held in place begin to slide into the sea at an accelerated rate.</p>
</div>

<div class=callout3>
<h2>In total, 21 ice shelves</h2><p>on the Antarctica Peninsula broke apart between 2000 and 2020. At sustained warming levels between 2째C and 3째C, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet will be lost almost completely and irreversibly over thousands of years.</p>
